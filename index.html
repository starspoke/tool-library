        <h3>
            What is the Tool Library?
        </h3>
    </p>

    <p>
        Essentially, the Tool Library is a simple but (i think) awesome concept to create a
        database of tools and resources that any of us have and are happy to mutually lend and borrow.
        <br /><br />
        It could be DIY tools, kitchen gadgets, garden equipment, camping or sports gear, board games,
        puzzles, books, instruments, arts and craft supplies, party deco, or even skills - basically,
        anything!
        <br /><br />
        Rather than having to go buy something new when you realise you need X thing, you can instead
        check the library, message whoever has one, borrow, use, and return! Bye bye single use consumption!
        Hello community sharing economy!
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
        <h3>
            Why is the Tool Library good? Why bother?
        </h3>
    </p>

    <p>
        Ultimately, these 'libraries' are great as they are not only a nice empowering community asset, promoting
        togetherness and inclusion, but save us all money and reduce waste, resource consumption, and clutter. Our
        planet and our wallets both love it.
        <br /><br />
        As a random example, we only need one person to already own a lawnmower for all of us to be able
        to mow our grass! If there's 20 of us, that's 95% less plastic, metal, production emissions, money,
        and space all saved! Not to mention also 19 lawn mowers worth of waste saved when they eventually
        break some day, and 19 people with barrier-free access to a specific tool.
    </p>

        <h3>
            How do I use the library?
        </h3>
    </p>

    <p>
        Using the library is really simple - it basically functions as a digital database of items alongside who owns them
        and how to get in touch. If you want to borrow something, head to the 'browse' page above and have a scroll
        through or search the items listed by other members of our community. All items have a title and contact details
        for you to get in touch with the owner to organise borrowing. Optionally, some items will also have images
        and short descriptions, more useful for tools that aren't super obvious or visual things like clothes!
        <br /><br />
        To list your own items in the library, simply head to the 'add an item' page above, fill out the relevant
        details, and hit 'submit' - that's it! Your new item should be updated onto the site very soon!

            FAQ's
        </h3>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            I don't own any power tools, so what can I actually contribute?
        </b>
        <br />
        So much!! It doesn't have to be tools! There are literally no limits on the things you can list on the library, as
        long as it's something you own and can feesibly lend out, there'll be someone out there who'll want to use it at
        some point. Whilst this is by no means an exhaustive list, some ideas for items include kitchen gadgets, gardening
        equipment, camping or sports gear, board games, puzzles, books, instruments, arts and craft supplies, party
        decorations, or even skills you have that you'd be happy to share.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Can I list things I don't want anymore on here to give away to someone?
        </b>
        <br />
        Whilst that is a great move in line with the tool library ethos, this site is just for items that are to be lent,
        borrowed, and duly returned after use. If we start introducing giveaways or sales, it all becomes much more confusing
        for those just looking for the temporary borrowing of things that the site is intended for. However,
        there are loads of brilliant places online you can give items away for free, if you're wanting to do so, such as
        Freecycle, Freegle, Facebook, and of course in-person donations to charity shops.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            I wanted to list an item, but there's already one listed. Should I bother?
        </b>
        <br />
        Yes! Definitely! For a million reasons, the existing item(s) may not be able to be borrowed at the moment - the owner
        may be away, it may already be lent out, in use, or need repairing, etc - so it's always ideal to have as many
        options as possible! Even if there's a few already, there's no harm in uploading yours too.
    </p>

        <b>
            I love this tool library, can I share the password with my friends / neighbours?
        </b>
        <br />
        Whilst the support is lovely, this site has been designed to be safe for use in our small community. In particular,
        we have no user profiles or identity verification, meaning anyone with the site password can submit anything of
        their own, and most importantly can view all item details, including peoples' names and contact info that they list
        with their items. This of course means other users are submitting their details under the trust that it's only
        available to other trusted individuals within our community. So, that's all to say, please don't share the password
        outside the community!
        If a friend needs to borrow something, you can of course feel free to borrow it on their behalf and act as a
        cool mysterious middle man who procures and returns the tool, but please don't share other people's contacts
        without their permission. Also, if you like the idea and want to set one up yourself for another community
        you're in, like your street, school parents, or a sports club, I'm happy to talk about it any time as I find
        it all very exciting.

            How do I remove an item I previously added?

        Just drop me a message with the specific details of your item, and I'll remove it for you.

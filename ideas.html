		<h3>
			What can I add to the Tool Library?<br />
			In short: Anything and everything!
		</h3>
	</p>

	<p>
		The list of things you can add to the Library is genuinely endless. It could be DIY tools,
		kitchen gadgets, garden equipment, camping or sports gear, board games, puzzles, books,
		instruments, arts and craft supplies, spare cables, party decorations, or even skills.
		<br /><br />
		If it's something you own, and you'd be happy to lend it to someone who needed it - you can add it!
